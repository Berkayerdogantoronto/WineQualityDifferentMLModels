# WineQualityDifferentMLModelsComparison 
In general, lower MAE, MSE, and RMSE values are preferable since they reflect higher predictive ability. A higher R2 value implies that the model fits the data better, with values closer to 1 being preferable. Based on these measures, Algorithm 2 appears to outperform Algorithms 1 and 3
